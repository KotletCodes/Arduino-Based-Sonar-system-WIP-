# Arduino-Based-Sonar-system-WIP-
I created a Sonary defence system using a Nema-17 stepper motor that rotates creating an scannable area. A HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor then scans the area and measures its distance to objects in cm. When something comes within 20cm, it stops and aims at that object. I plan to create a shooting mechanism soon with flywheels.
